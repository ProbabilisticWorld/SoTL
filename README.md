# Scholarship of Teaching and Learning

## About
* Started during 2019/2020 Faculty Learning Community
* This website will serve as my final "artefact" for the FLC

## The project
* **Broady speaking**: investigation of how students use the textbook to facilitate learning
	* This is not about _how often_ or _how much_ they use it (which as been studied), but in what _ways_ they are interacting with the textbook when they do use it
* **Originally:** about using worked examples
* **Revised** after getting preliminary data: _**(add something here)**_

## Longer story
- [] Make this something like a narrative of the process
- [] Discuss original though process, literature review, etc.
- [] Explicitly state what "kind" of question this is (q.v. Hutchings' taxonomy of quesitions)
- [] Discuss how the scope/specific question changed after preliminary data collection in winter 2020

## Data(?)
- [] Include review of the data that I took; may belong in the narrative above

## Current
- [] Overview of where the project is at the end of Spring 2020
