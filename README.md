# Scholarship of Teaching and Learning

## About
* Started during 2019/2020 Faculty Learning Community
* This website will serve as my final "artefact" for the FLC

Broadly speaking, I'm interested in how students interact with a textbook. I started out wanting to investigate specifically how students use example problems to help them learn. I ran a pilot study where I presented a student with new material and a worked example, and asked them to solve a similar problem. I was (pleasantly) surprised to see evidence that this student did refer to the example problem! However, I realized that this setup was actuallyÂ too limited.

## The project
* **Broady speaking**: investigation of how students use the textbook to facilitate learning
	* This is not about _how often_ or _how much_ they use it (which as been studied), but in what _ways_ they are interacting with the textbook when they do use it
* **Originally:** about using worked examples
* **Revised** after getting preliminary data: _**(add something here)**_

## Longer story
- [ ] Make this something like a narrative of the process
- [ ] Discuss original though process, literature review, etc.
- [ ] Explicitly state what "kind" of question this is (q.v. Hutchings' taxonomy of quesitions)
- [ ] Discuss how the scope/specific question changed after preliminary data collection in winter 2020

## Data(?)
- [ ] Include review of the data that I took; may belong in the narrative above
- General observation: the *vast majority* of hits for any given module came **after** the relevant quiz
	- For example, one file went from 262 rows of data to 23 when I removed hits from after the quiz date.
		- More dramatic: from 153 lines to 3
		- The example module for spring potential energy was only accessed by *2* students before the quiz!
		- An example with rotational kinetic energy only had 3 students view it!
  - No wonder people did poorly on the quizzes! *What the hell did they expect!?*
		- The energy quiz (from which all the above examples come) had a remarkably low average. I allowed them to do corrections---which I saw no evidence of helping, given their exam grades---to make up for this. I should've told them to just go fuck themselves! Why should I do more work because they can't be assed to *read the fucking book* or *work on any fucking examples!?*
	- Also notable: few hits from the quiz day itself; students not referencing the book while taking the quiz. (Hopefully they were using their notes.)
